## my personal website
This is the code for my personal website. 
It is vanilla HTML, CSS, JS hosted on Github pages. On my media page I use a Spotify API, so it's also deployed through Vercel. I bought my domain through Cloudfare so it is also connected there. 

I used to just work on this through the Github websites and have to commit my code, wait, and refresh 2 minutes later to see my changes. Thank you Konrad for making me use VS Code and showing me live preview.
